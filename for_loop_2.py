For Loop 2- Python
Welcome to the part 2 of For Loops in Python. In this question, we'll learn to print characters of a string at even indices.

You are given a string str, you need to print its characters at even indices(index starts at 0).

Note: Please go through the range function to understand how to jump 2 steps.

Example 1:

Input:
str = DoctorPhenomenal
Output:
DcoPeoea
Example 2:

Input:
str = Geeks
Output:
Ges
Your Task:
This is a function problem. You don't need to take input. Just complete the function stringJumper() that takes str as input.

'''

def stringJumper(str):
    for i in range(0,len(str),2):  ## from 0 to length of str and skip 2
        print(
            str[i],
            end="")  ##printing character and separating characters by nothing
